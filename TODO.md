- I should write tests for the REST layer of ingredients crud
- I have started working on recipes CRUD. I have implemented few basic input types, now I am going to move on
  to implement the actual logic and repositories. One though is in my mind though and namely if it makes sense to have
  recipes identified by their canonical names the same way as ingredients. On the one hand it makes sense to me because
  it makes searching much easier, while on the other hand it does not make sense since there may be multipe recipe 
  variations for preparing the same dish.
